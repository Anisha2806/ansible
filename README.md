- **Agentless:** Leverages existing SSH connections without extra agents or open ports.
- **Human-friendly:** Describes infrastructure in a way that's both machine- and human-readable.
- **Secure by design:** Focus on security, auditability, and easy code review.
- **Instant management:** No software bootstrapping on remote machines.
- **Language flexibility:** Write modules in any dynamic language, not just Python.
